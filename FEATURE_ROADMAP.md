# Full Feature Roadmap — ESP32 Embedded Firmware Lab

**Repository:** Prepared for `https://github.com/athompson36/esp32`  
**Context:** Unified ESP32 development environment (local-first, containerized, deterministic)  
**Last updated:** 2025-02-17

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This roadmap aligns the **embedded firmware lab** (CONTEXT.md) with current **T-Beam 1W** work (MeshCore + Meshtastic port), **MeshCore upstream** roadmap, and **repo readiness** for GitHub. Priorities: determinism, hardware safety, reproducibility, isolation, and scalability.

---

## 2. Lab Infrastructure (CONTEXT.md Alignment)

### 2.1 Directory & Contract Compliance

| ID | Feature | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|--------|
| L1 | Adopt CONTEXT.md device layout under `/devices` | 🔴 Not started | Current work lives in `t-beam_1w/`; migrate to `devices/t_beam_1w/` per contract |
| L2 | Per-device contract: `firmware/`, `configs/`, `pinmaps/`, `notes/` | 🔴 Not started | Each device folder must have these four subdirs |
| L3 | Firmware layout: `meshtastic/`, `meshcore/`, `expresslrs/`, `custom/` under device | 🟡 Partial | MeshCore present; Meshtastic port in separate project; unify under one device |
| L4 | Overlay-only customization; no direct upstream edits | 🟢 Followed | MeshCore/Meshtastic use overlays/patches; preserve |

**Actions:**

- Create `devices/t_beam_1w/` (or `tbeam_1w`) with `firmware/`, `configs/`, `pinmaps/`, `notes/`.
- Move or symlink `t-beam 1w meshcore` → `devices/t_beam_1w/firmware/meshcore/repo` and apply overlays in `firmware/meshcore/overlays/`.
- Move or reference Meshtastic port → `devices/t_beam_1w/firmware/meshtastic/` (repo + overlays).
- Populate `pinmaps/` from `TBEAM_1W_PINMAP.md` and variant docs; `notes/` from T-BEAM-1W-FIXES, MESHTASTIC-IMPROVEMENTS, BATTERY-FIX.

### 2.2 Containers & Toolchains

| ID | Feature | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|--------|
| L5 | `platformio-lab` container (Meshtastic, MeshCore, Arduino) | 🔴 Not started | CONTEXT: never mix toolchains; build in container |
| L6 | `esp-idf-lab` container (ESP-IDF, LVGL) | 🔴 Not started | For custom/ESP-IDF-based firmware |
| L7 | `rust-embedded-lab` (PineTime, Embassy, NRF) | 🔴 Not started | Future |
| L8 | `rf-lab` (SDR, spectrum, LoRa sniffing) | 🔴 Planned | Future |

**Actions:**

- Add `docker/` with Dockerfiles for `platformio-lab` (Ubuntu 22.04 + PlatformIO), `esp-idf-lab` as needed.
- Document “build in container, flash from macOS” and avoid Docker USB passthrough unless required.

### 2.3 Build Orchestrator & Artifacts

| ID | Feature | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|--------|
| L9 | `/orchestrator` — single entry point: `lab build <device> <firmware>` | 🔴 Not started | Select container, mount volumes, run build, export artifacts |
| L10 | `/artifacts` — versioned outputs: `artifacts/<device>/<firmware>/<version>/` | 🔴 Not started | Never auto-delete artifacts |
| L11 | `/ota` — staging, private channels, fleet deployments | 🔴 Planned | Future |
| L12 | `/shared` — RF tuning, PA limits, thermal, flashing offsets, board quirks | 🔴 Not started | Central place for hardware intelligence; Cursor searches here first |

**Actions:**

- Create `artifacts/`, `shared/`, optional stubs for `orchestrator/`, `ota/`.
- Implement minimal orchestrator (e.g. shell script) that invokes correct container and writes to `artifacts/`.
- Migrate T-Beam 1W RF/PA/fan/PMU notes into `shared/` (e.g. `shared/t_beam_1w/`).

### 2.4 Scripts & Toolchain Detection

| ID | Feature | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|--------|
| L13 | Top-level `scripts/` for build/flash/validate | 🟡 Partial | Build/flash scripts exist under meshtastic-tbeam-1w-firmware; generalize for lab |
| L14 | Toolchain detection by presence of `platformio.ini`, `idf.py`, `Cargo.toml`, etc. | 🔴 Not started | Cursor/orchestrator must detect before suggesting commands |

## 3. T-Beam 1W — MeshCore (Current Implementation)

### 3.1 Hardware & Variant

| ID | Feature | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|--------|
| T1 | LilyGO T-Beam 1W (ESP32-S3 + SX1262 + 1W PA) variant | 🟢 Done | `lilygo_tbeam_1w_SX1262` in meshcore |
| T2 | Single I2C bus (GPIO 8/9), PMU on Wire | 🟢 Done | T-BEAM-1W-FIXES |
| T3 | TX power cap 22 dBm, PA ramp 800 µs, smart fan 5 s post-TX | 🟢 Done | MESHTASTIC-IMPROVEMENTS, BATTERY-FIX |
| T4 | 7.4 V 2S LiPo battery range (6.0–8.4 V) | 🟢 Done | Firmware; apps may need 2S support |
| T5 | PMU (AXP2101) init order, NULL-safe battery, fallback 7400 mV | 🟢 Done | T-BEAM-1W-FIXES |
| T6 | GPS (persistent flags, skip-detect), boot screen timing | 🟢 Done | T-BEAM-1W-FIXES |
| T7 | Pinmap doc (TBEAM_1W_PINMAP.md) and variant alignment | 🟢 Done | Meshtastic pinmap filled; MeshCore pins in T-BEAM-1W-FIXES |

**Remaining:**

- Document cost-reduced variant (no AXP2101): keep fallback, document in `shared/` and device `notes/`.
- Optional: temperature-based fan, adaptive TX power, duty-cycle limit (see MESHTASTIC-IMPROVEMENTS “Future”).

### 3.2 MeshCore Firmware Variants

| ID | Feature | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|--------|
| T8 | Companion Radio (BLE) — build, flash, run | 🟢 Done | UI, battery, BLE |
| T9 | Room Server — build, flash, run | 🟢 Done | BBS, serial CLI, remote mgmt |
| T10 | Repeater — build, flash, run | 🟢 Done | OLED, serial CLI |

**Actions:**

- Ensure all three are buildable via lab orchestrator and artifacts path once L9/L10 are in place.
- Add `configs/` examples for each variant under device folder.

## 5. MeshCore Upstream Roadmap (Integration)

Items from MeshCore README “Road-Map / To-Do” that affect this lab or T-Beam 1W:

| ID | Feature | Status (upstream) | Lab action |
|----|---------|--------------------|------------|
| MC1 | Repeater/Bridge: standardise Transport Codes (zoning/filtering) | 🔴 Todo | Track; test when released |
| MC2 | Core: round-trip manual path support | 🔴 Todo | Track |
| MC3 | Companion + Apps: multiple sub-meshes, off-grid client repeat | 🔴 Todo | Track; may need app + firmware matrix |
| MC4 | Core + Apps: LZW message compression | 🔴 Todo | Track |
| MC5 | Core: dynamic CR for weak vs strong hops | 🔴 Todo | Track |
| MC6 | Core: multiple virtual nodes on one device | 🔴 Todo | Track |
