# Rebuild containers when changes are made

When you make changes to code that runs inside the lab containers, **always rebuild the containers** so the running images reflect the latest code.

## When to rebuild

- Any changes under **inventory/app/** (Flask app, config, static, templates)
- Any changes under **mcp-server/** (MCP server source or config)

## How to rebuild

From the **repo root**, run:

```bash
./scripts/rebuild-containers.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
docker compose -f inventory/app/docker-compose.yml build
docker compose -f mcp-server/docker-compose.yml build
```

## After editing

1. Run the rebuild script (or the two `docker compose ... build` commands above).
2. If the user runs the app with Docker, remind them to restart the container(s) or run `docker compose -f inventory/app/docker-compose.yml up` to use the new image.
3. For the MCP server, Cursor will use the new image on the next MCP invocation if the image was rebuilt.
